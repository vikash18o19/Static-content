## Matching Logic

### Scoring
* **Rule:** Weighted keyword and concept match between JD signals and capability keywords; add +10 for explicit functional terms; +5 for tool matches; -10 if JD indicates in-house leadership-only scope (strategy-only).
* **Thresholds:**
    * **Strong Match:** >=70
    * **Possible Match:** 50-69

### Overrides
* If JD is primarily about fund accounting/NAV/LP reporting → CFO Office Services.
* If JD is primarily about data/analytics/engineering/AI → Data Intelligence Group.
* If JD is primarily about investment research, modeling, diligence, or deal work → Research and Investment Services.
* If JD is primarily about CRM/list building/AP-AR/shared services/design/desk research → Process Support Services.

### Avoid Matching or Responding in the following cases:
* If the 1st question does not contain a JD.
* Irrelevant questions (example : related to books, movies, people etc)
* Irrelevant or out of scope domains
